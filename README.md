# Customer Personality Analysis-Statistical Analysis
 Exploratory Data Analysis, Hypothesis Testing, ANOVA, and T-Tests on Customer Personality Data
## Overview
This project demonstrates exploratory data analysis, hypothesis testing, one-way ANOVA, and T-tests using the Customer Personality dataset from Kaggle. The goal is to analyze the relationship between education and income, and to determine whether education level significantly affects income.

## Dataset
- Source: [Customer Personality Analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imnikhilaror/customer-personality-analysis)
- Variables include customer demographics, product preferences, and income.

## Objectives
- Perform descriptive statistics and data exploration.
- Test hypothesis using one-way ANOVA to determine the relationship between education and income.
- Perform independent two-sample T-tests for hypothesis testing.
- Visualize data distributions and interpret the results.

## Steps
1. Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, outliers, and data types.
2. Descriptive Statistics: Explore data distribution with histograms and boxplots.
3. Hypothesis Formulation:
   - H0: No significant difference in income across education levels.
   - H1: Significant difference in income across education levels.
4. One-Way ANOVA: Test income differences across multiple education levels.
5. Independent T-Test: Compare income between two specific education groups.
6. Interpretation: Draw conclusions from statistical tests.
